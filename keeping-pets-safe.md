## Keeping pets safe

**NEVER leave your animals chained up outside.**

- **Plan ahead.** If you have to evacuate, find a shelter or hotel that is pet friendly, as many do not allow pets. Also make sure that they take your type of pet or don't have any other restrictions, many shelters that accept pets only take dogs and cats.
- **Have a "grab and go" bag.** It should include an identification collar and rabies tag, a leash or harness, a muzzle (if needed), a supply of food and treats, water and food bowls, medication, medical records, a photo of your pet, newspaper and bags for clean-up. If you have a carrier, be ready to bring that as well.
- **Microchip your pets ahead of time.** Should your pet become lost during the storm, microchips can help authorities easily reunite you with your pets. Make sure your contact information is up to date. 
- **Contain your pets.** Crate cats and small dogs and put large dogs on a leash. That way if you have to evacuate quickly, you will not waste time trying to find pets that may be scared or hiding. 
- **Stay as calm as possible.** Your pet may be able to detect your panic. If you stay calm, you'll be able to keep your pet calm as well.
- **Contact your local animal shelter ahead of time with any questions.** Your county's animal control agency should be able to help you with any questions you might have.
