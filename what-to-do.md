## Hurricane preparation

Having a plan in place ahead of time is important. Here are some things to keep in mind before, during, and after a storm.

#### What to do before a hurricane

- **Charge electronic devices** This includes laptops, tablets, phones, and portable batteries.
- **Charge any device that provides light** This also includes laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, cell phones, even old phones. Old cell phones can still be used for dialing 911. Glow sticks can also provide light for a few hours (stand them upgright in a glass or jar to make a lantern). Make sure you have working flashlights and extra batteries.
- **Plan ahead with an emergency kit.** This should include food, water, medical items and important documents.
- **Make a communication plan.** Find a friend or relative who lives out of the state that everyone can contact to let them know you are safe. Make sure everyone has a cell phone and portable phone charger, coins or a prepaid phone card. Use social media, including Facebook's [Crisis Response](https://www.facebook.com/crisisresponse/), feature to let friends and other family know you're safe. Check on all family members, set up emergency back up plans, and check on elderly neighbors.
- **Unplug** Just before the storm, unplug electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm. If the power does go out, make sure lights and ceiling fans are turned off. Turn off any televisions or other devices. Turn up the air conditioning (if possible). The more devices that are pluged in/turned on when the power gets restored the more instaneous load is placed on the electrical grid, which can cause additional power outages as electrical equipment fails due to massive surge loads.
- **Gas up** Make sure vehicles have a full tank of gas or a full charge and that you have at least a spare gas container for your car. If you have a generator, makes sure it's full and that you have spare fuel if possible. Rememebr, hybrid and electric vehicles can usually also be used to charge electronic devices without using up a lot of gas or charge for themselves.
- **Food safety** See [Food safety](food-safety.md) for more information.
- **Hydrate** Be well hydrated before the storm hits, and avoid foods that will make you dehydrated.
- **Get clean** Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C. Toss any expiring food, clean cat litter boxes, empty all trash cans, including bathrooms. Remove anything that ight cause an odor when the A/C it off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. Scrub all bathrooms so you're starting with a clean, odor free environment. Store water filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. Clean all counters. Buy Clorox Wipes (or similar) for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty, smelly dishes.
- **Paper plates and plastic cups** Have a supply of paper plates, plastic cups, and plastic utensils to use for eating. These don't need to be washed.
- **Pick your emergency safe place** Find an interior safe place you can ride out the storm, if necessary, such as a closet under the stairs. (No Harry Potter references, please!) Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out.
- **Be aware of your surroundings.** Find out the elevation level of your property (how far above or below sea level you are) and if you're in a flood zone. ***Check your flood zone every year, as it may have changed.*** If there are levees, dams or rivers in your area, find out if they pose a flooding hazard for you and your home. 
- **Learn evacuation routes and shelters.** Find out where you would go and who to get there in case you need to evacuate. If you have pets, look for pet friendly shelters and hotels. Make sure you have a clear exit path from your house. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if  you don't evacuate. Remember to pack for pets as well.
- **Plan to secure your property.**  Use permanent storm shutters or board up your windows with marine plywood that has already been cut to fit. Tape won't prevent windows from breaking. If you can, take a video of hour house and contents - walk from room to room, open cabinets/drawers and closets. This will help in case you need to make an insurance claim later. It will show proof of items and help you list all the times (by helping your memory so you don't forget anything).
- **Check the exterior of your home.** Make sure to trim trees and shrubs so they are wind-resistant. Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts. Bring in all outdoor furniture, decorations and garbage cans. If it's too big to bring in, try to secure it to the ground in some way. Turn off propane tanks (unless it's for a whole house generator, in which case you'll want the propane tank on so the generator will work.)
- **Make sure you have a supply of water.** Fill **clean and sanitized** bath tubs, sinks, and other large containers with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep them from collecting dust. Freeze water in Ziploc storage bags (or put ice cubes in them) to pack your freezer. This will help keep the freezer cold if you lose power, can be used to help keep refrigerator items cold, and also provide fresh water for drinking. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill with water and store in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. Without power, there isn't enough water pressure from the pumping stations to refil the toilet after it's flushed. You can pour water from one of the trash cans into the toilet to help. Remember, if it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown flush it down!
- **Stay informed.** Watch the local news, the Weather Channel or listen to weather news radio for the latest information.
- **Important records** Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
- **Cash is king** Make sure you have cash on hand
- **Don't forget the pets** Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for your pets. If you have to evacuate, remember pets are family too! Take them with you!

#### What to do during a hurricane

- **Stay informed.** Watch the local news, the Weather Channel or listen to weather news radio for the latest information.

If you're unable to evacuate:

- **Go to a wind-safe room.** This can be a small interior room, closet or hallway on the lowest level of your house. If you don't have one, move as far away from windows and glass doors as you can. Close all interior doors and secure and brace external doors.  Keep curtains and blinds closed. Avoid elevators. You can also lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.

#### What to do after a hurricane

- **Stay informed.** Watch the local news, the Weather Channel or listen to weather news radio for the latest information.
- **Use flashlights, not candles.** Any battery-powered light sources should be turned on outside before entering a building, as the battery could produce a spark that might ignite leaking gas.
- **Don't return home until it's declared safe to do so.** If you've evacuated, only return when notified that it is safe to do so. If you cannot return home and you need shelter, go to your nearest shelter.
- **Be careful when traveling on roads.** Avoid floodwaters, flooded roads and washed out bridges. Watch out for fallen objects, downed electrical wires and weakened structures.
- **Report safety hazards.** Dangling or loose power lines should be reported to the power company.
- **Beware of spoiled and contaminated food and water.** Don't drink or prepare food with tap water until you're sure it is not contaminated. Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt, throw it out.

**NEVER use a generator inside a home or enclosed area.** This includes garages, crawl spaces, sheds or similar areas, even if the area has a fan or open doors or windows. Deadly carbon monoxide can build up quickly and can linger for hours.
