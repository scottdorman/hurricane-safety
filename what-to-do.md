## Hurricane preparation

Having a plan in place ahead of time is important. Here are some things to keep in mind before, during, and after a storm.

#### What to do before a hurricane

- **Plan ahead with an emergency kit.** This should include food, water, medical items and important documents.
- **Make a communication plan.** Find a friend or relative who lives out of the state that everyone can contact to let them know you are safe. Make sure everyone has a cell phone and portable phone charger, coins or a prepaid phone card. Use social media, including Facebook's [Safety Check](https://www.facebook.com/about/safetycheck/), feature to let friends and other family know you're safe.
- **Be aware of your surroundings.** Find out the elevation level of your property (how far above or below sea level you are) and if you're in a flood zone. If there are levees, dams or rivers in your area, find out if they pose a flooding hazard for you and your home.
- **Learn evacuation routes and shelters.** Find out where you would go and who to get there in case you need to evacuate. If you have pets, look for pet friendly shelters and hotels.
- **Plan to secure your property.**  Use permanent storm shutters or board up your windows with marine plywood that has already been cut to fit. Tape won't prevent windows from breaking.
- **Check the exterior of your home.** Make sure to trim trees and shrubs so they are wind-resistant. Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts. Bring in all outdoor furniture, decorations and garbage cans. If it's too big to bring in, try to secure it to the ground in some way. Turn off propane tanks (unless it's for a whole house generator, in which case you'll want the propane tank on so the generator will work.)
- **Make you have a supply of water.** Fill a **clean and sanitized** bath tub and other large containers with water. Freeze water in Ziploc storage bags (or put ice cubes in them) to pack your freezer. This will help keep the freezer cold if you lose power, can be used to help keep refrigerator items cold, and also provide fresh water for drinking.
- **Stay informed.** Watch the local news, the Weather Channel or listen to weather news radio for the latest information.

#### What to do during a hurricane

- **Stay informed.** Watch the local news, the Weather Channel or listen to weather news radio for the latest information.

If you're unable to evacuate:

- **Go to a wind-safe room.** This can be a small interior room, closet or hallway on the lowest level of your house. If you don't have one, move as far away from windows and glass doors as you can. Close all interior doors and secure and brace external doors.  Keep curtains and blinds closed. Avoid elevators. You can also lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.

#### What to do after a hurricane

- **Stay informed.** Watch the local news, the Weather Channel or listen to weather news radio for the latest information.
- **Use flashlights, not candles.** Any battery-powered light sources should be turned on outside before entering a building, as the battery could produce a spark that might ignite leaking gas.
- **Don't return home until it's declared safe to do so.** If you've evacuated, only return when notified that it is safe to do so. If you cannot return home and you need shelter, go to your nearest shelter.
- **Be careful when traveling on roads.** Avoid floodwaters, flooded roads and washed out bridges. Watch out for fallen objects, downed electrical wires and weakened structures.
- **Report safety hazards.** Dangling or loose power lines should be reported to the power company.
- **Beware of spoiled and contaminated food and water.** Don't drink or prepare food with tap water until you're sure it is not contaminated. Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt, throw it out.

**NEVER use a generator inside a home or enclosed area.** This includes garages, crawl spaces, sheds or similar areas, even if the area has a fan or open doors or windows. Deadly carbon monoxide can build up quickly and can linger for hours.
