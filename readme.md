# Hurricane Preparadness

Let's face it, by the time a hurricane hits, it's too late to start getting prepared. Disaster preparedness is all about having an established plan ahead of time.

### What is a hurricane?
A hurricane, sometimes called a typhoon, is a severe tropical storm. They can form in almost any ocean and are typically accompanied by severe thunderstorms and a counterclockwise circulation of winds (in the Northern hemisphere; the Southern hemisphere, it's a clockwise circulation).

### Why are they dangerous?
Hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage to coastal areas and inland for several hundred miles. Sustained winds in excess of 155 miles per hour can be produced, as well as tornadoes and even stronger wind gusts. They can also create storm surges, flooding, and flying debris.

Slow moving hurricanes traveling into mountainous regions can produce very heavy rain leading to landslides or mudslides.

### What do the categories mean?

|Category|Wind Speed|Expected Damage|
|:---:|:---|:---|
|1|74 - 95 mph<br/>64 - 82 knots|&bull; Very dangerous winds will produce some damage.<br/>&bull; Minor damage to exterior of homes.<br/>&bull; Toppled tree branches, uprooting of smaller trees.<br/>&bull; Extensive damage to power lines, power outages|
|2|96 - 110 mph<br/>83 - 95 knots|&bull; Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage<br/>&bull; Major damage to exterior of homes<br/>&bull; Uprooting of small trees and many roads blocked<br/>&bull; Guaranteed power outages for long periods of time (days to weeks)|
|3|111 - 129 mph<br/>96 - 113 knots|&bull; Devastating damage will occur<br/>&bull; Extensive damage to exterior of homes<br/>&bull; Many trees uprooted and many roads blocked<br/>&bull; Extremely limited availability of water and electricity|
|4|130 - 156 mph<br/>114 - 135 knots|&bull; Catastrophic damage will occur<br/>&bull; Loss of roof structure and/or some exterior walls<br/>&bull; Most trees uprooted and most power lines down<br/>&bull; Isolated residential due to debris pile up<br/>&bull; Power outages lasting for weeks to months|
|5|Greater than 156 mph<br/>Greater than 135 knots|&bull; Catastrophic damage will occur<br/>&bull; A high percentage of homes will be destroyed<br/>&bull; Fallen trees and power lines isolate residential areas<br/>&bull; Power outages lasting for weeks to months<br/>&bull; Most areas will be uninhabitable|

### When is hurricane season?
#### Atlantic hurricane season
The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June to November. The peak season from mid-August to late October. All of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal areas are at risk for hurricanes. 
#### Eastern Pacific hurricane season
The Eastern Pacific hurricane season lasts from mid-May to the end of November. Parts of the southwest United States, and the Pacific coast also experience heave rains and floods from hurricanes.

## What's this site all about?
The information in this site is my own best attempt at putting together a comprehensive resource to help anyone prepare for a hurricane. It's not perfect, and will never claim to be perfect or complete. It's just here to help answer some common questions and give people a place they can go to in order to find resources.

I've tried to put together general resources, such as preparedness checklists, emergency number guides, and explanations. I'm also trying to put together state-by-state and county-by-county information.
