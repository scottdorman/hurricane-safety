# Hurricane Preparedness

Let's face it, by the time a hurricane hits, it's too late to start preparing. Disaster preparedness is all about having an established plan ahead of time. 

The information on this site is my best attempt at putting together a comprehensive resource to help anyone prepare for a hurricane. It's not perfect and will never claim to be perfect or complete. It's just here to help answer some common questions and give people a place they can use to find resources.

I've tried to put together general resources, such as preparedness checklists, emergency number guides, and explanations. I'm also trying to put together state-by-state and county-by-county information.

# When is hurricane season?
## Atlantic hurricane season
The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June to November, with the peak from mid-August to late October. All the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal areas are at risk for hurricanes. 
## Eastern Pacific hurricane season
The Eastern Pacific hurricane season lasts from mid-May to the end of November. Parts of the southwest United States and the Pacific coast also experience heavy rains and floods from hurricanes.

# Hurricanes Explained
## What is a hurricane?
A hurricane, sometimes called a typhoon, is a severe tropical storm that can form in almost any ocean. Typically accompanied by severe thunderstorms, they have a counterclockwise circulation of winds (in the Northern hemisphere; in the Southern hemisphere, it's a clockwise circulation).

## Why are they dangerous?
Hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage to coastal areas and inland for several hundred miles. They can also produce sustained winds over 155 miles per hour (and even stronger wind gusts), tornadoes, storm surges, flooding, and flying debris.

Slow-moving hurricanes traveling into mountainous regions can produce very heavy rain leading to landslides or mudslides.

## What do the categories mean?

|Category|Wind Speed|Expected Damage|
|:---:|:---|:---|
|1|74 - 95 mph<br/>64 - 82 knots|&bull; Very dangerous winds will produce some damage.<br/>&bull; Minor damage to exterior of homes.<br/>&bull; Toppled tree branches, uprooting of smaller trees.<br/>&bull; Extensive damage to power lines, power outages|
|2|96 - 110 mph<br/>83 - 95 knots|&bull; Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage<br/>&bull; Major damage to the exterior of homes<br/>&bull; Uprooting of small trees and many roads blocked<br/>&bull; Guaranteed power outages for long periods (days to weeks)|
|3|111 - 129 mph<br/>96 - 113 knots|&bull; Devastating damage will occur<br/>&bull; Extensive damage to exterior of homes<br/>&bull; Many trees uprooted and many roads blocked<br/>&bull; Extremely limited availability of water and electricity|
|4|130 - 156 mph<br/>114 - 135 knots|&bull; Catastrophic damage will occur<br/>&bull; Loss of roof structure and/or some exterior walls<br/>&bull; Most trees uprooted and most power lines down<br/>&bull; Isolated residential due to debris pile up<br/>&bull; Power outages lasting for weeks to months|
|5|Greater than 156 mph<br/>Greater than 135 knots|&bull; Catastrophic damage will occur<br/>&bull; A high percentage of homes will be destroyed<br/>&bull; Fallen trees and power lines isolate residential areas<br/>&bull; Power outages lasting for weeks to months<br/>&bull; Most areas will be uninhabitable|
