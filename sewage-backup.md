# How to prevent sewer backup

Flooding can also lead to sewer backup through bathtubs and toilets. 

Here are some practical steps you can take to protect your home.

Having a check-valve professionally installed can help, but that can be expensive and any debris caught in your sewer line (sewage, paper or flushable personal products) will prevent a check-valve from closing properly, resulting in sewer back-up. A more reliable option is to use a manually closed knife-type gate valve and it is relatively inexpensive. It can be installed by a licensed plumber or a homeowner, if qualified.

If you don't have time, or the inclination to install a check-valve or a knife-type gate, here's a low cost solution.

A tall kitchen can garbage bag inserted into the clean-out, then filled half-way up the pipe with sand or dirt will do an excellent job, then wet lightly. To remove, insert garden hose into bag and carefully flush out the sand, while holding bag securely. Do not allow partially filled plastic bag to wash down into the sewer line or you will plug up the line, creating the very problem you are trying to avoid. Punch a hole in the bag and drain the water. Whichever method you choose, make sure that you can easily remove the clean-out cap, usually located outside the house. Some are white PVC, but older homes may have cast iron caps and may require a plumber's expertise to open. Clean threads and grease with Vaseline. Screw cap on hand-tight for easy removal in an emergency.

 NOTE: Remember, now that you have prevented sewage from backing up into your house, you have also stopped it from draining. Before closing off the drain, you should turn off the water supply to the toilet and flush. There will be only a small amount in the bottom. You can then fit a kitchen garbage bag into the toilet and lower the lid. Change bags as needed. For washing up, use a dishpan that you can empty out the window (since your doors will be sandbagged).
