# Food safety

Cook any meats or other perishable foods in advance. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks.

If you have to evacuate your home, you have no way of knowing if power was lost but restored prior to coming back home. That means you don't know if your frozen food thawed and then refroze or if your refrigerated items became room temperature before cooling again.

Here's an easy way to know.

Before you leave, freeze a small cup of water. Once it's frozen, put a quarter (or any other coin) on top and put it back in the freezer. When you return home, check the coin. If it's at the bottom of the cup, you know power was off long enough for everything to thaw. If it's somewhere inside the water, things partially thawed.
