# How to properly sandbag for flood protection

Sandbags can be an effective way to prevent floodwaters from entering your home, but not everyone knows the best way to use them.

Here are some practical steps you can take to protect your home.

1. Decide how you will enter and exit your home. This can be done by removing a screen from a low window or by using a pre-cut a piece of plywood that can be placed or anchored in front of a door (that opens inward) and that you can step over.
2. Use 2" duct or packing tape (if the surface is dry or can be dried) to seal the opening around your door across the bottom and up the sides for several feet. (One thing to note here is that the duct tape may damage the wall surface and remove some paint, but ultimately that's a minor repair compared to dealing with flood damage.)
3. Attach lightweight plastic in front of the opening extending at least 1 foot on either side and 1 - 2 feet in front on the ground. Use 1-2 mil plastic such as painter's
sheeting or lawn or trash bags because heavier plastics do not seal securely. If you only have the thinner .7 mil plastic painter's sheeting, you can double it over.
4. Place filled sandbags on the plastic, making sure they settle snugly to
the door surface and extend beyond the actual door opening. Place additional rows,
overlapping joints for 1 foot or more depending on the amount of flooding expected.

While woven sandbags are generally the most effective, you can improvise if they are not available. Garbage bags filled with wet towels, bedding or dirt/sand/sod from the yard can be used, as well as bags of play sand. Whatever you use, make sure they have sufficient weight to prevent floating. Remove air from bags to prevent breakage.

After the flooding is over you can remove the sandbags.

During the hurricane season, you may want to save your sandbags in case you need them again. Store them in a dry area out of the sun to prevent deterioration (a garage, shed or under a tarp) and off the ground as sandbags can cause staining on concrete or pool decks. When you do dispose of them, since many contain sand or sandy dirt, simply add the contents to your yard or garden.

Even if you aren’t located on the coast, you may experience flooding during a severe thunderstorm or a prolonged period of daily rains.
